The PATE verifier is a static relational verifier for binaries with the
goal of proving that two binaries have the same observable behaviors.
It is intended for proving that security micropatches applied to
binaries are safe.  When it cannot, the verifier provides detailed
explanations that precisely characterize the difference in behavior
between the two binaries.  The verifier is intended to be usable by
\emph{domain experts}, rather than verification experts, and its
explanations are designed to be in domain terms as much as possible.
The verifier is intended to enable users to:
\begin{itemize}
\item precisely reason about the effects of patches applied to binaries,
\item explain potential differences in observable behaviors, accounting
  for all possible execution paths, and thus
\item reduce the time required to develop safe binary patches.
\end{itemize}
